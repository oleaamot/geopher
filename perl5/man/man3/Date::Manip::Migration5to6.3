.SH "NAME"
Date::Manip::Migration5to6 \- how to upgrade from 5.xx to 6.00
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
When upgrading from Date::Manip 5.xx to 6.00, a few changes may be
necessary to your scripts.
.PP
The Date::Manip::Changes5to6 document lists in more detail the ways in
which Date::Manip changed, but very few of these actually entail
changes to your script.
.PP
It should be noted that once the changes are made to your script,
it will no longer run correctly in 5.xx.
.SH "NECESSARY AND SUGGESTED CHANGES"
.IX Header "NECESSARY AND SUGGESTED CHANGES"
The following changes are necessary, or strongly suggested:
.IP "\fBReading config files with Date_Init\fR" 4
.IX Item "Reading config files with Date_Init"
If you use Date_Init to read any config files (if you do business mode
calculations, you probably do), you should remove all of the following
config variables from your call to Date_Init:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   GlobalCnf=FILE
\&   PersonalCnf=FILE
\&   PathSep=*
\&   IgnoreGlobalCnf=*
\&   PersonalCnfPath=*
.Ve
.Sp
and replace them with:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   ConfigFile=FILE
.Ve
.Sp
where \s-1FILE\s0 is now the full path to a config file. Also, the ConfigFile
argument should be the first argument in Date_Init.
.IP "\fBDate_ConvTZ\fR" 4
.IX Item "Date_ConvTZ"
The Date_ConvTZ function has changed. It should now take 3 arguments:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $date = Date_ConvTZ($date,$from,$to);
.Ve
.Sp
If \f(CW$from\fR is not given, it defaults to the local time zone. If \f(CW$to\fR is
not given, it defaults to the local time zone.
.Sp
The date is converted from the \f(CW$from\fR time zone into the \f(CW$to\fR
time zone. Both should be any time zone (or alias) supported by
Date::Manip.
.Sp
The old \f(CW$errlevel\fR argument is no longer handled.
.IP "\fBConvTZ and \s-1TZ\s0 config variables\fR" 4
.IX Item "ConvTZ and TZ config variables"
If you use either the ConvTZ or \s-1TZ\s0 config variables, you should
replace them with either SetDate or ForceDate. See the
Date::Manip::Config document for information.
.Sp
The \s-1TZ\s0 variable will continue to work until Dec 2015 at which point
it will be removed.
.IP "\fBOther deprecated config variables\fR" 4
.IX Item "Other deprecated config variables"
The following config variables have been deprecated, but will continue
to function (though they will be removed at a future date):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   TZ           (removed Mar 2016)
.Ve
.Sp
The following variables have been removed. If you use any of them,
you may need to modify your scripts:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&   IntCharSet
\&   GlobalCnf
\&   PersonalCnf
\&   PathSep
\&   IgnoreGlobalCnf
\&   PersonalCnfPath
\&   ConvTZ
\&   Internal
\&   TodayIsMidnight
\&   DeltaSigns
\&   UpdateCurrTZ
\&   ResetWorkdDay
.Ve
.IP "\fBtoday, yesterday, tomorrow\fR" 4
.IX Item "today, yesterday, tomorrow"
If you parse the strings \*(L"today\*(R", \*(L"yesterday\*(R", or \*(L"tomorrow\*(R" in order
to get the time now, or 24 hours in the past/future, this will no
longer work.  These strings now refer strictly to the date (so \*(L"today\*(R"
is the current day at midnight, \*(L"yesterday\*(R" is the previous day at
midnight, etc.).
.Sp
To get the time now, 24 hours ago, or 24 hours in the future, you
would need to parse the strings \*(L"now\*(R", \*(L"\-24:00:00\*(R", or \*(L"+24:00:00\*(R"
respectively.
.IP "\fBDo not use Memoize\fR" 4
.IX Item "Do not use Memoize"
In 5.xx, it was documented that you could use the module Memoize to
speed up Date::Manip, especially when sorting dates.
.Sp
This information is no longer accurate. Using Memoize in conjunction
with Date::Manip should have little impact on performance, and may
lead to incorrect results, especially if you change config variables.
.Sp
Please refer to \*(L"\s-1GENERAL CHANGES\*(R"\s0 in Date::Manip::Changes5to6 for
more information.
.PP
If you find other instances where it is necessary to modify your
script, please email me so that I can add that information to this
document.
