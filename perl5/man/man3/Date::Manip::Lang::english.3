.IP "\fBIgnored words\fR" 4
.IX Item "Ignored words"
In writing out dates in common forms, there are a number of words
that are typically not important.
.Sp
There is frequently a word that appears in a phrase to designate
that a time is going to be specified next.  In English, you would
use the word \s-1AT\s0 in the example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   December 3 at 12:00
.Ve
.Sp
The following words may be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   at
.Ve
.Sp
Another word is used to designate one member of a set.  In English,
you would use the words \s-1IN\s0 or \s-1OF:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   1st day OF December
\&   1st day IN December
.Ve
.Sp
The following words may be used:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   of
\&   in
.Ve
.Sp
Another word is use to specify that something is on a certain date.  In
English, you would use \s-1ON:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   ON July 5th
.Ve
.Sp
The following words may be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   on
.Ve
.IP "\fBWords that set the date, time, or both\fR" 4
.IX Item "Words that set the date, time, or both"
There are some words that can be used to specify a date, a
time, or both relative to now.
.Sp
Words that set the date are similar to the English words 'yesterday'
or 'tomorrow'.  These are specified as a delta which is added to the
current time to get a date.  The time is \s-1NOT\s0 set however, so the delta
is only partially used (it should only include year, month, week, and
day fields).
.Sp
The following words may be used:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   ereyesterday         \-0:0:0:2:0:0:0
\&   overmorrow           +0:0:0:2:0:0:0
\&   today                0:0:0:0:0:0:0
\&   tomorrow             +0:0:0:1:0:0:0
\&   yesterday            \-0:0:0:1:0:0:0
.Ve
.Sp
Words that set only the time of day are similar to the English words
\&'noon' or 'midnight'.
.Sp
The following words may be used:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   midnight             00:00:00
\&   noon                 12:00:00
.Ve
.Sp
Words that set the entire time and date (relative to the current
time and date) are also available.
.Sp
In English, the word 'now' is one of these.
.Sp
The following words may be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   now                  0:0:0:0:0:0:0
.Ve
.IP "\fBHour/Minute/Second separators\fR" 4
.IX Item "Hour/Minute/Second separators"
When specifying the time of day, the most common separator is a colon (:)
which can be used for both separators.
.Sp
Some languages use different pairs.  For example, French allows you to
specify the time as 13h30:20, so it would use the following pairs:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   : :
\&   h :
.Ve
.Sp
The first column is the hour-minute separator and the second column is
the minute-second separator.  Both are perl regular expressions.  When
creating a new translation, be aware that regular expressions with utf\-8
characters may be tricky.  For example, don't include the expression '[x]'
where 'x' is a utf\-8 character.
.Sp
A pair of colons is \s-1ALWAYS\s0 allowed for all languages.  If a language allows
additional pairs, they are listed here:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Not defined in this language
.Ve
.IP "\fBFractional second separator\fR" 4
.IX Item "Fractional second separator"
When specifying fractional seconds, the most common way is to use a
decimal point (.).  Some languages may specify a different separator
that might be used.  If this is done, it is a regular expression.
.Sp
The decimal point is \s-1ALWAYS\s0 allowed for all languages.  If a language allows
another separator, it is listed here:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Not defined in this language
