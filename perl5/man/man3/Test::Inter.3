.SH "NAME"
Test::Inter \- framework for more readable interactive test scripts
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is another framework for writing test scripts. Much of the syntax
is loosely inspired by Test::More, and Test::Inter has most of it's
functionality, but it is not a drop-in replacement.
.PP
Test::More (and other existing test frameworks) suffer from two
weaknesses, both of which have prevented me from ever using them:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   None offer the ability to access specific tests in
\&   a reasonably interactive fashion, primarily for
\&   debugging purposes
\&
\&   None offer the ability to write the tests in
\&   whatever format would make the tests the most
\&   readable
.Ve
.PP
The way I write and use test scripts, existing Test::* modules are not
nearly as useful as they could be.
.PP
Test scripts written using Test::More work fine when running as part
of the test suite, but debugging an individual test requires extra
steps, and the tests themselves are not as readable as they should be.
.SH "INTERACTIVE EXECUTION"
.IX Header "INTERACTIVE EXECUTION"
One requirement that I have of a test framework is the ability to
interact with it.
.PP
I do most of my debugging using test scripts. When I find a bug, I
write a test case for it (typically by adding it to an existing test
script) and then debug it using the test script.  Then I leave the
test there to ensure that the bug won't come back (hopefully).
.PP
Since I use test scripts in a very interactive way (often in the
debugger), I want to be able to do the following trivially:
.IP "\fBEasy access to a specific test or tests\fR" 4
.IX Item "Easy access to a specific test or tests"
I'd like to be able to run only a single test, or a subset
of tests.
.IP "\fBEasily set breakpoints in the debugger\fR" 4
.IX Item "Easily set breakpoints in the debugger"
Setting a breakpoint in the debugger to run up to the start
of the Nth test is one of the most common tasks I want to do
when I'm debugging a failed test.
.PP
To illustrate the first point, in Test::More, a series of tests might be
specified in a test script as shown in the following example (line numbers
added for convenience):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   ...
\&
\&   100:  # test 1
\&   101:  $result = func("apples","bushels");
\&   102:  is($result, "enough");
\&   103:
\&   104:  # test 2
\&   105:  $result = func("grapefruit","tons");
\&   106:  is($result, "enough");
\&   107:
\&   108:  # test 3
\&   109:  $result = func("oranges","boatloads");
\&   110:  is($result, "insufficient");
\&   111:
\&   112:  # tests 4\-6
\&   113:  foreach my $arg (qw(pears plums pineapple)) {
\&   114:    $result = func($arg,"boxes");
\&   115:    is($result, "enough");
\&   116:  }
\&
\&   ...
.Ve
.PP
Say you ran the test suite, and test 3 failed.  To debug it you have
to open up the test script, find the 3rd test, and set the appropriate
breakpoint.  In this case, you'll want to break at line 109.
.PP
None of these steps are impossible of course, but it will take some time to
get it right.  It becomes harder when there are lots of tests (imagine that you
want to test the 117th test instead of the 3rd test) or when tests are wrapped
up in loops, embedded in subroutines, or other similar situations.
.PP
As an example, what if it's the 5th test that fails in the example
above.  Now the break point will be a conditional one, so you have to
figure out not only the line, but the condition the appropriate state
during that test.  In this case, you need to stop at line 114 when
\&\f(CW$arg\fR is 'plums'.
.PP
Wouldn't it be far better to set a break point in func when the Nth test is
reached?  With Test::Inter, you can.
.PP
So for the above script, the debugger commands that you would use to
debug the 3rd test are:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   Test::More :   b 109
\&   Test::Inter:   b func ($::TI_NUM==3)
.Ve
.PP
and the 5th test are:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   Test::More :   b 114  ($arg eq \*(Aqplums\*(Aq)
\&   Test::Inter:   b func ($::TI_NUM==5)
.Ve
.PP
It would also be nice to be able to skip the first two tests... perhaps
they take a long time to run, and I want to get right to work on test 3.
You can do this easily too by setting the \f(CW$::TI_START\fR variable.
.PP
There are some other variables that can be used to specify which test or
tests to run described in the \*(L"\s-1TEST::INTER VARIABLES\*(R"\s0 section below.
.PP
The other thing I want to do when I run the test scripts interactively
is to see more information which will assist in debugging a failed
test.
.PP
This can be controlled with variables such as \s-1TI_QUIET, TI_MODE,\s0 and \s-1TI_WIDTH\s0
described below in the \*(L"\s-1TEST::INTER VARIABLES\*(R"\s0 section.
.SH "READABLE TESTS"
.IX Header "READABLE TESTS"
The other feature that I wanted in a test suite is the ability to
define the tests in a format that is natural and readable \s-1FOR THE
TESTS.\s0  In almost every case, it is best to think of a test script
as consisting of two separate parts: a script part, and a test part.
.PP
The script part of a test script is the least important part! It's
usually fairly trivial, rarely needs to be changed, and is not the
focus of the test script.
.PP
The tests part of the script \s-1IS\s0 the important part, and these should
be expressed in a form that is natural to them, easy to maintain, easy
to read, and easy to modify, and none of these should involve
modifying the script portion of the test script in general. Because
the content of the tests is the important part of the script, the
emphasis should be in making them more readable, even at the expense
of the script portion.  As a general rule, if the script portion of
the test script obscures the tests in any way, it's not written
correctly!
.PP
The solution to this is well understood, and is common to many other
systems where you are mixing two \*(L"languages\*(R".  The task of correctly
specifying both the tests and the test script is virtually identical
to the task of creating a \s-1PHP\s0 script which consists of a mixture of
\&\s-1PHP\s0 and \s-1HTML,\s0 or the task of creating a template file using some
templating system where the file consists of a mixture of text to be
displayed and templating commands.  It is well understood in each of
these cases that the more the two \*(L"languages\*(R" are interwoven, the less
readable both are, and the harder it is to maintain.  The more you are
able to separate the two, the easier both are to read and maintain.
.PP
As often as possible, I want the tests to be written in some sort of
text format which can be easily viewed and modified (usually as a
simple table) with no perl commands interspersed. I want to the
freedom to define the tests in one section (a long string, the \s-1DATA\s0
section, or even in a separate file) which is easily readable. This
may introduce the necessity of parsing it, but it makes it
significantly easier to maintain the tests.
.PP
This flexibility makes it much easier to read the tests (as opposed to
the script) which is the fundamental content of a test script.
.PP
Looking again at the example test script, you can see that there
is far too much perl interspersed with the tests.
.PP
It's difficult to read the tests individually in this script because
there is too much perl code among them, and virtually impossible to
look at them as a whole.
.PP
It is true that looking at this particular example, it is very
simple... but the script \s-1ISN\s0'T the content you're interested in (and
bear in mind that many test scripts are nowhere near this simple). The
\&\s-1REAL\s0 content of this script are the tests, which consist of the
function arguments and the expected result. Although it's not
impossible to see each of these in the script above, it's not in a
format that is conducive to studying the tests, and especially not for
examining the list of tests as a whole.
.PP
Now, look at an alternate way of specifying the tests using this module:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $tests = "
\&
\&     apples     bushels   => enough
\&
\&     grapefruit tons      => enough
\&
\&     oranges    boatloads => insufficient
\&
\&     pears      boxes     => enough
\&
\&     plums      boxes     => enough
\&
\&     pineapple  boxes     => enough
\&
\&   ";
\&
\&   $o\->tests(tests => $tests,
\&             func  => \e&func);
.Ve
.PP
Here, it's easy to see the list of tests, and adding additional
tests is a breeze.
.SH "CREATING A TEST"
.IX Header "CREATING A TEST"
This module supports a number of methods for defining tests, so you
can use whichever one is most convenient (including methods that are
identical to Test::More if that really is the best method).
.PP
Every test may have several pieces of information:
.IP "\fBA name\fR" 4
.IX Item "A name"
Every test is automatically assigned a number, but it may be useful to
specify a name of a test (which is actually a short description of the
test). Whenever a test result is reported, the name will be given (if
one was specified).
.Sp
The name may not have a '#' in it.
.Sp
The name is completely optional, but makes the results more readable.
.IP "\fBAn expected result\fR" 4
.IX Item "An expected result"
In order to test something, you need to know what result was
expected (or in some cases, what result was \s-1NOT\s0 expected).
.IP "\fBA function and arguments \s-1OR\s0 a result\fR" 4
.IX Item "A function and arguments OR a result"
You also need to know the results that you're comparing to
the expected results.
.Sp
This can be obtained by simply working with a set of results,
or a function name and a set of arguments to pass to it.
.IP "\fBConditions\fR" 4
.IX Item "Conditions"
It is useful to be able to specify state information at the start
of the test suite (for example, to see if certain features are
available), and some tests may only run if those conditions are
met.
.Sp
If no conditions are set for a test, it will always run.
.IP "\fBTodo tests\fR" 4
.IX Item "Todo tests"
Some tests may be marked as 'todo' tests. These are test which are
allowed to fail (meaning that they have been put in place for an
as-yet unimplemented feature). Since it is expected that the test
will fail, the test suite will still pass, even if these tests
fail.
.Sp
The tests will still run and if they pass, a message is issued
saying that the feature is now implemented, and the tests should
be graduated to non-todo state.
.SH "BASE METHODS"
.IX Header "BASE METHODS"
.IP "\fBnew\fR" 4
.IX Item "new"
.Vb 1
\&   $o = new Test::Inter [$name] [%options];
.Ve
.Sp
This creates a new test framework. There are several options which may
be used to specify which tests are run, how they are run, and
what output is given.
.Sp
The entire test script can be named by passing in \f(CW$name\fR.
.Sp
All options can be set in four different ways.
.Sp
First, you can pass in a hash of \fB\s-1OPT\s0 =\fR \s-1VAL\s0> pairs in the new method.
So, to set the \fBstart\fR option, the \f(CW%options\fR) hash would contain:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   start => VALUE
.Ve
.Sp
Second, you can set an environment variable.  This will override any
value passed in the first way.  The environment variable is named
\&\s-1TI_XXX\s0 where \s-1XXX\s0 is the fully capitalized option.  So:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $ENV{TI_START} = VALUE
.Ve
.Sp
The third method, which overrides the previous two, is to set a
global variable.  It is also named \s-1TI_XXX\s0 in the main namespace, so
to set it this way, set:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $::TI_START = VALUE
.Ve
.Sp
The final method is to call one of the methods below and these override
all other methods.
.Sp
Each of the allowed options are described below in the following base
methods:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&   start
\&   end
\&   testnum
\&   plan
\&   abort
\&   quiet
\&   mode
\&   skip_all
\&   width
\&   use_lib
.Ve
.IP "\fBversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "version"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->version();
.Ve
.Sp
Returns the version of the module.
.IP "\fBencoding\fR" 4
.IX Item "encoding"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->encoding($encoding);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW$encoding\fR is any value that can be passed as an encoding to perl's
Encode::decode function.
.Sp
Use this if your test strings contain characters in other encodings.
.IP "\fBstart\fR" 4
.IX Item "start"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqstart\*(Aq => $N;
\&   $o\->start($N)
.Ve
.Sp
To define which test you want to start with, set the \fBstart\fR option
as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.
.Sp
When the start test is defined, most tests numbered less than N are
completely ignored. If the tests are being run quietly (see the \fBquiet\fR
method below), nothing is printed out for these tests. Otherwise, a
skip message is printed out.
.Sp
One class of tests \s-1IS\s0 still executed. Tests run using the \fBrequire_ok\fR
or \fBuse_ok methods\fR (to test the loading of modules) are still run.
.Sp
If no value (or a value of 0) is used, tests run from the first test.
.IP "\fBend\fR" 4
.IX Item "end"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqend\*(Aq => $M;
\&   $o\->end($M);
.Ve
.Sp
To define which test you want to end with, set the \fBend\fR option
as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.
.Sp
When the end test is defined, all tests numbered more than M are
completely ignored. If the tests are being run quietly (see the quiet
method below), nothing is printed out for these tests. Otherwise, a
skip message is printed out.
.Sp
If no value is given, it defaults to 0 (which means that all remaining
tests are run).
.IP "\fBtestnum\fR" 4
.IX Item "testnum"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqtestnum\*(Aq => $N;
\&   $o\->testnum($N);
.Ve
.Sp
To run only a single test, set the \fBtestnum\fR option as described in
the \fBnew\fR method above.
.Sp
It is equivalent to setting both the start and end tests to \f(CW$N\fR.
.IP "\fBplan\fR" 4
.IX Item "plan"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBdone_testing\fR" 4
.IX Item "done_testing"
.PD
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqplan\*(Aq => $N;
\&   $o\->plan($n);
\&
\&   $o\->done_testing();
\&   $o\->done_testing($n);
.Ve
.Sp
The \s-1TAP API\s0 (the 'language' used to run a sequence of tests and see
which ones failed and which ones passed) requires a statement of the
number of tests that are expected to run.
.Sp
This statement can appear at the start of the test suite, or at
the end.
.Sp
If you know in advance how many tests should run in the test script,
you can set the \fBplan\fR option as described in the \fBnew\fR method
above to the number of tests.
.Sp
If you know how many tests should run at the end of the test script,
you can pass in a non-zero integer to the done_testing method.
.Sp
Frequently, you don't really care how many tests are in the script
(especially if new tests are added on a regular basis). In this case,
you still need to include a statement that says that the number of
tests expected is however many were run. To do this, call the
done_testing method with no argument.
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 if the plan method is used, it \s-1MUST\s0 be used before any tests are
run (including those that test the loading of modules). If the
done_testing method is used, it \s-1MUST\s0 be called after all tests are
run. You must specify a plan or use a done_testing statement, but you
cannot do both.
.Sp
It is \s-1NOT\s0 strictly required to set a plan if the script is only run
interactively, so if for some reason this module is used for test
scripts which are not part of a standard perl test suite, the plan
and done_testing statements are optional. As a matter of fact, the
script will run just fine without them... but a perl installer will
report a failure in the test suite.
.IP "\fBabort\fR" 4
.IX Item "abort"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqabort\*(Aq => 0/1/2;
\&   $o\->abort(0/1/2);
.Ve
.Sp
To define how you want a failure to be treated, set the \fBabort\fR option
as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.  The \fBabort\fR option can take
a value of 0, 1, or 2.
.Sp
If this is set to 1, the test script will run unmodified until
a test fails. At that point, all remaining tests will be skipped.
If it is set to 2, the test script will run until a test fails
at which point it will exit with an error code of 1.  With a value
of 0, failed tests will be reported, but the script will continue.
.Sp
In both cases, todo tests will \s-1NOT\s0 trigger the abort behavior.
.IP "\fBquiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "quiet"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqquiet\*(Aq => 0/1/2;
\&   $o\->quiet(0/1/2);
.Ve
.Sp
To define how you want failures to be reported, set the \fBquiet\fR option
as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.  The \fBquiet\fR option can take
a value of 0, 1, or 2.
.Sp
If this is set to 0 (the default), all information will be printed
out. If it is set to 1, some optional information will not be printed.
If it is set to 2, all optional information will not be printed.
.IP "\fBmode\fR" 4
.IX Item "mode"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqmode\*(Aq => MODE;
\&   $o\->mode(MODE);
.Ve
.Sp
Test::Inter scripts can be run in either an interactive mode, or as
part of a test suite with different behaviors.  To select the mode,
set the \fBmode\fR option as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.  The
\&\fBmode\fR option can take a value of 'inter' or 'test'.
.Sp
When run in test mode, it prints out the results using the
\&\s-1TAP\s0 grammar (i.e. 'ok 1', 'not ok 3', etc.).
.Sp
When run in interactive mode, it prints out results in a more
human readable format.
.IP "\fBwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "width"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqwidth\*(Aq => WIDTH;
\&   $o\->width(WIDTH);
.Ve
.Sp
The width option can be set as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.
.Sp
\&\s-1WIDTH\s0 is the width of the terminal (for printing out failed test
information). It defaults to 80, but it can be set to any width (and
lines longer then this are truncated). If \s-1WIDTH\s0 is set to 0, no
truncation is done.
.IP "\fBuse_lib\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_lib"
.Vb 3
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aquse_lib\*(Aq => VALUE;
\&   $o\->use_lib(VALUE);
\&   $o\->use_lib();
.Ve
.Sp
By default, the library included in the module distribution will be added
to the search path for modules, so a 'use \s-1MODULE\s0' line should find the
version stored in this module distribution.
.Sp
If \s-1VALUE\s0 is set to 'off', the search path will not be modified automatically.
.Sp
You may add the library path at a later time by calling:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $o\->use_lib(\*(Aqon\*(Aq);
\&   $o\->use_lib();
.Ve
.Sp
Note: both calls must be used. The first sets the option, the second actually
modifies the search path.
.IP "\fBskip_all\fR" 4
.IX Item "skip_all"
.Vb 2
\&   $o = new Test::Inter \*(Aqskip_all\*(Aq => REASON;
\&   $o\->skip_all(REASON);
.Ve
.Sp
The skip_all option can be set as described in the \fBnew\fR method above.
.Sp
If this is set, the entire test script will be skipped for the reason
given. This must be done before any test is run, and before any plan
number is set.
.Sp
The skip_all can also be called at any point during the script (i.e.
after tests have been run). In this case, all remaining scripts will
be skipped.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $o\->skip_all(REASON,FEATURE,FEATURE,...);
\&   $o\->skip_all(\*(Aq\*(Aq,FEATURE,FEATURE,...);
.Ve
.Sp
This will skip all tests (or all remaining tests) unless all <\s-1FEATURE\s0>s
are available.  \fB\s-1REASON\s0\fR can be entered as an empty string and the
reason the tests are skipped will be a message about the missing
feature.
.IP "\fBfeature\fR" 4
.IX Item "feature"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->feature($feature,$val);
.Ve
.Sp
This defines a feature. If \f(CW$val\fR is non-zero, the feature is available.
Otherwise it is not.
.IP "\fBdiag\fR" 4
.IX Item "diag"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBnote\fR" 4
.IX Item "note"
.PD
.Vb 2
\&   $o\->diag($message);
\&   $o\->note($message);
.Ve
.Sp
Both of these print an optional message. Messages printed with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`note\*(C'\fR method are always optional and will be omitted if the \fBquiet\fR
option is set to 1 or 2. Messages printed with the \f(CW\*(C`diag\*(C'\fR method are
optional and will not be printed if the \fBquiet\fR option is set to 2,
but they will be printed if the \fBquiet\fR method is set to 1.
.IP "\fBtestdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "testdir"
.Vb 3
\&   $o\->testdir();
\&   $o\->testdir(\*(Aqmod\*(Aq);
\&   $o\->testdir(\*(Aqlib\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Occasionally, it may be necessary to know the directory where Test::Inter
gets some of it's information.  By default, the directory containing the
tests will be returned, but if the optional argument 'mod' is included,
it will return the path to the module distribution (which should include
both a lib and t subdirerctory).  If the argument 'lib' is included, it
will return the directory where the libraries are stored.
.SH "METHODS FOR LOADING MODULES"
.IX Header "METHODS FOR LOADING MODULES"
Test scripts can load other modules (using either the perl \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR commands).  There are three different modes for doing this
which determine how this is done.
.IP "\fBrequired\fR" 4
.IX Item "required"
By default, this is used to test for a module that is required for
all tests in the test script.
.Sp
Loading the module is treated as an actual test in the test suite. The
test is to determine whether the module is available and can be
loaded. If it can be loaded, it is, and it is reported as a successful
test. If it cannot be loaded, it is reported as a failed test.
.Sp
In the result of a failed test, all remaining tests will be skipped
automatically (except for other tests which load modules).
.IP "\fBfeature\fR" 4
.IX Item "feature"
In feature mode, loading the module is not treated as a test (i.e. it
will not print out an 'ok' or 'not ok' line. Instead, it will set a
feature (named the same as the module) which can be used to determine
whether other tests should run or not.
.IP "\fBforbid\fR" 4
.IX Item "forbid"
In a few very rare cases, we may want to test for a module but expect
that it not be present. This is the exact opposite of the \fBrequired\fR
mode.
.Sp
Successfully loading the module is treated as a test failure. In the
event of a failure, all remaining tests will be skipped.
.PP
The methods available are:
.IP "\fBrequire_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "require_ok"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->require_ok($module [,$mode]);
.Ve
.Sp
This is used to load a module using the perl \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR function. If
\&\f(CW$mode\fR is not passed in, the default mode (\fBrequired\fR) is used to test
the existence of the module.
.Sp
If \f(CW$mode\fR is passed in, it must be either the string 'forbid' or
\&'feature'.
.Sp
If \f(CW$mode\fR is 'feature', a feature named \f(CW$module\fR is set if the module
was able to be loaded.
.IP "\fBuse_ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "use_ok"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->use_ok(@args [,$mode]);
.Ve
.Sp
This is used to load a module with \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR, or check a perl version.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   BEGIN { $o\->use_ok(\*(Aq5.010\*(Aq); }
\&   BEGIN { $o\->use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq); }
\&   BEGIN { $o\->use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq,2.05); }
\&   BEGIN { $o\->use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq,\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq,\*(Aqbar\*(Aq); }
\&   BEGIN { $o\->use_ok(\*(AqSome::Module\*(Aq,2.05,\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq,\*(Aqbar\*(Aq); }
.Ve
.Sp
are the same as:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   use 5.010;
\&   use Some::Module;
\&   use Some::Module 2.05;
\&   use Some::Module qw(foo bar);
\&   use Some::Module 2.05 qw(foo bar);
.Ve
.Sp
Putting the \fBuse_ok\fR call in a \s-1BEGIN\s0 block allows the functions to
be imported at compile-time and prototypes are properly honored.
You'll also need to load the Test::Inter module, and create the
object in a \s-1BEGIN\s0 block.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$mode\fR acts the same as in the \fBrequire_ok\fR method.
.SH "METHODS FOR RUNNING TEST"
.IX Header "METHODS FOR RUNNING TEST"
There are several methods for running tests. The \fBok\fR, \fBis\fR, and \fBisnt\fR
methods are included for those already comfortable with Test::More
and wishing to stick with the same format of test script. The
\&\fBtests\fR method is the suggested method though since it makes use
of the full power of this module.
.IP "\fBok\fR" 4
.IX Item "ok"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->ok(TESTS);
.Ve
.Sp
A test run with ok looks at a result, and if it evaluates to 0 (or
false), it fails. If it evaluates to non-zero (or true), it
passes.
.Sp
These tests do not require you to specify the expected results.  If
expected results are given, they will be compared against the result
received, and if they differ, a diagnostic message will be printed,
but the test will still succeed or fail based only on the actual
result produced.
.Sp
These tests require a single result and either zero or one expected
results.
.Sp
To run a single test, use any of the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->ok();          # always succeeds
\&
\&   $o\->ok($result);
\&   $o\->ok($result,$name);
\&   $o\->ok($result,$expected,$name);
\&
\&   $o\->ok(\e&func);
\&   $o\->ok(\e&func,$name);
\&   $o\->ok(\e&func,$expected,$name);
\&
\&   $o\->ok(\e&func,\e@args);
\&   $o\->ok(\e&func,\e@args,$name);
\&   $o\->ok(\e&func,\e@args,$expected,$name);
.Ve
.Sp
If \f(CW$result\fR is a scalar, the test passes if \f(CW$result\fR is true. If
\&\f(CW$result\fR is a list reference, the test succeeds if the list contains
any defined values. If \f(CW$result\fR is a hash reference, the test
succeeds if the hash contains any key with a value that is not
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`\e&func\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\e@args\*(C'\fR are passed in, then \f(CW$result\fR is generated by
passing \f(CW@args\fR to \f(CW&func\fR and behaves identically to the calls where
\&\f(CW$result\fR is passed in.  If \f(CW\*(C`\e&func\*(C'\fR is passed in but no arguments, the
function takes no arguments, but still produces a result.
.Sp
If an expected value is passed in and the result does not match it,
a diagnostic warning will be printed, even if the test passes.
.IP "\fBis\fR" 4
.IX Item "is"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBisnt\fR" 4
.IX Item "isnt"
.PD
.Vb 2
\&   $o\->is(TESTS);
\&   $o\->isnt(TESTS);
.Ve
.Sp
A test run with \fBis\fR looks at a result and tests to see if it is identical to
an expected result. If it is, the test passes. Otherwise it fails. In the
case of a failure, a diagnostic message will show what result was actually
obtained and what was expected.
.Sp
A test run with \fBisnt\fR looks at a result and tests to see if the result obtained
is different than an expected result. If it is different, the test passes.
Otherwise it fails.
.Sp
The is method can be called in any of the following ways:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   $o\->is($result,$expected);
\&   $o\->is($result,$expected,$name);
\&
\&   $o\->is(\e&func,$expected);
\&   $o\->is(\e&func,$expected,$name);
\&
\&   $o\->is(\e&func,\e@args,$expected);
\&   $o\->is(\e&func,\e@args,$expected,$name);
.Ve
.Sp
The \fBisnt\fR method can be called in exactly the same way.
.Sp
As with the \fBok\fR method, the result can be a scalar, hashref, or listref. If it is
a hashref or listref, the entire structure must match the expected value.
.IP "\fBtests\fR" 4
.IX Item "tests"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->tests($opt=>$val, $opt=>$val, ...)
.Ve
.Sp
The options available are described in the following section.
.IP "\fBfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "file"
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->file($func,$input,$outputdir,$expected,$name [,@args]);
.Ve
.Sp
Sometimes it may be easiest to store the input, output, and expected
output from a test in a text file. In this case, each line of
output will be treated as a single test, so the output and expected
output must match up exactly.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$func\fR is a reference to a function which will produce a temporary
output file.
.Sp
If \f(CW$input\fR is specified, it is the name of the input file.  If it is
empty, no input file will be used.  The input file can be fully specified,
or it can be relative to the test directory.
.Sp
If \f(CW$outputdir\fR is passed in, it is the directory where the output
file will be written.  It can be fully specified, or relative to the
test directory.  If \f(CW$outputdir\fR is left blank, the temporary
file will be written to the test directory.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$expected\fR is the name of a file which contains the expected output.
It can be fully specified, or it will be checked for in the test
directory.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$name\fR is the name of this series of tests.
.Sp
\&\f(CW@args\fR are extra arguments to pass to the test function.
.Sp
The function will be called with the arguments:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   &$func( [$input,] $output,@args);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW$input\fR is only passed in if it was passed in to this method.  If no
input file is specified, nothing will be passed to the function.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$output\fR is the name of a temporary file where the output will
be written to.
.SH "USING THE TESTS METHOD"
.IX Header "USING THE TESTS METHOD"
It is expected that most tests (except for those that load a module)
will be run using the tests method called as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $o\->tests(%options);
.Ve
.PP
The following options are available:
.IP "\fBname\fR" 4
.IX Item "name"
.Vb 1
\&   name => NAME
.Ve
.Sp
This sets the name of this set of tests. All tests will be given the
same name.
.IP "\fBtests\fR" 4
.IX Item "tests"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBfunc\fR" 4
.IX Item "func"
.IP "\fBexpected\fR" 4
.IX Item "expected"
.PD
In order to specify a series of tests, you have to specify either
a function and a list of arguments, or a list of results.
.Sp
Specifying the function and list of arguments can be done using
the pair:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   func  => \e&FUNCTION
\&   tests => TESTS
.Ve
.Sp
If the \fBfunc\fR option is not set, \fBtests\fR contains a list of results.
.Sp
A list of expected results may also be given. They can be included
in the
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   tests => TESTS
.Ve
.Sp
option or included separately as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   expected => RESULTS
.Ve
.Sp
The way to specify these are covered in the next section \s-1SPECIFYING THE TESTS.\s0
.IP "\fBfeature\fR" 4

.IP "\fBdisable\fR" 4
.IX Item "disable"
.PD
.Vb 1
\&   feature => [FEATURE1, FEATURE2, ...]
\&
\&   disable => [FEATURE1, FEATURE2, ...]
.Ve
.Sp
The default set of tests to run is determined using the start, end, and skip_all
methods discussed above. Using those methods, a list of tests is obtained, and
it is expected that these will run.
.Sp
The feature and disable options modify the list.
.Sp
If the feature option is included, the tests given in this call will only run
if \s-1ALL\s0 of the features listed are available.
.Sp
If the disable option is included, the tests will be run unless \s-1ANY\s0 of the features
listed are available.
.IP "\fBskip\fR" 4

.Vb 1
\&   skip => REASON
.Ve
.Sp
Skip these tests for the reason given.
.IP "\fBtodo\fR" 4
.IX Item "todo"
.Vb 1
\&   todo => 0/1
.Ve
.Sp
Setting this to 1 says that these tests are allowed to fail. They represent
a feature that is not yet implemented.
.Sp
If the tests succeed, a message will be printed notifying the developer that
the tests are now ready to promote to actual use.
.SH "SPECIFYING THE TESTS"
.IX Header "SPECIFYING THE TESTS"
A series of tests can be specified in two different ways. The tests
can be written in a very simple string format, or stored as a list.
.PP
Demonstrating how this can be done is best done by example, so let's
say that there is a function (func) which takes two arguments, and
returns a single value.  Let's say that the expected output (and the
actual output) from 3 different sets of arguments is:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   Input   Expected Output  Actual Output
\&   \-\-\-\-\-   \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&   1,2     a                a
\&   3,4     b                x
\&   5,6     c                c
.Ve
.PP
(so in this case, the first and third tests pass, but the 2nd
one will fail).
.PP
Specifying these tests as lists could be done as:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ],
\&      expected => [ [a],   [b],   [c] ],
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
Here, the tests are stored as a list, and each element in the list is a
listref containing the set of arguments.
.PP
If the \fBfunc\fR option is not passed in, the tests option is set to a list
of results to compare with the expected results, so the following is
equivalent to the above:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      tests    => [ [a],   [x],   [c] ],
\&      expected => [ [a],   [b],   [c] ],
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
If an argument (or actual result) or an expected result is only a
single value, it can be entered as a scalar instead of a list ref, so
the following is also equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ],
\&      expected => [ a,     b,     [c] ],
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
The only exception to this is if the single value is itself a list
reference.  In this case it \s-1MUST\s0 be included as a reference. In other
words, if you have a single test, and the expected value for this test
is a list reference, it must be passed in as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   expected => [ [ \e@r ] ]
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOT\s0 as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   expected => [ \e@r ]
.Ve
.PP
Passing in a set of expected results is optional. If none are passed
in, the tests are treated as if they had been passed to the \fBok\fR
method (i.e. if they return something true, they pass, otherwise they
fail).
.PP
The second way to specify tests is as a string. The string is a
multi-line string with each tests being separate from the next test by
a blank line.  Comments (lines which begin with '#') are allowed, and
are ignored. Whitespace at the start and end of the line is ignored.
.PP
The string may contain the results directly, or results may be passed
in separately. For example, the following all give the same sets of
tests as the example above:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "
\&                   # Test 1
\&                   1 2 => a
\&
\&                   # Test 2
\&                   3 4 => b
\&
\&                   5 6 => c
\&                  ",
\&   );
\&
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "
\&                   1 2
\&
\&                   3 4
\&
\&                   5 6
\&                  ",
\&       expected => [ [a], [b], [c] ]
\&   );
\&
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => [ [1,2], [3,4], [5,6] ],
\&      expected => "
\&                   a
\&
\&                   b
\&
\&                   c
\&                  ",
\&   );
\&
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "
\&                   1 2
\&
\&                   3 4
\&
\&                   5 6
\&                  ",
\&      expected => "
\&                   a
\&
\&                   b
\&
\&                   c
\&                  ",
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
The expected results may also consist of only a single set of results (in this
case, it must be passed in as a listref). In this case, all of the tests are
expected to have the same results.
.PP
So, the following are equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "
\&                   1 2 => a b
\&
\&                   3 4 => a b
\&
\&                   5 6 => a b
\&                  ",
\&   );
\&
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "
\&                   1 2
\&
\&                   3 4
\&
\&                   5 6
\&                  ",
\&      expected  => [ [a, b] ],
\&   );
\&
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "
\&                   1 2
\&
\&                   3 4
\&
\&                   5 6
\&                  ",
\&      expected  => "a b",
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
The number of expected values must either be 1 (i.e. all of the tests
are expected to produce the same value) or exactly the same number as
the number of tests.
.PP
The parser is actually quite powerful, and can handle multi-line
tests, quoted strings, and nested data structures.
.PP
The test may be split across any number of lines, provided there is
not a completely blank line (which signals the end of the test), so
the following are equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   tests => "a b c",
\&   tests => "a b
\&             c",
.Ve
.PP
Arguments (or expected results) may include data structures. For
example, the following are equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   tests => "[ a b ] { a 1 b 2 }"
\&   tests => [ [ [a,b], { a=>1, b=>2 } ] ]
.Ve
.PP
Whitespace is mostly optional, but there is one exception. An item must
end with some kind of delimiter, so the following will fail:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   tests => "[a b][c d]"
.Ve
.PP
The first element (the list ref [a b]) must be separated from the second
element by the delimiter (which is whitespace in this case), so it must
be written as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   tests => "[a b] [c d]"
.Ve
.PP
As already demonstrated, hashrefs and listrefs may be included and
nested. Elements may also be included inside parens, but this is optional
since all arguments and expected results are already treated as lists,
so the following are equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   tests => "a b c"
\&   tests => "(a b) c"
.Ve
.PP
Although parens are optional, they may make things more readable, and allow
you to use something other than whitespace as the delimiter.  Since parens are
actually ignored, a string '()' is also ignored, so do not use empty
parentheses.
.PP
If the character immediately following the opening paren, brace, or
bracket is a punctuation mark, then it is used as the delimiter
instead of whitespace. For example, the following are all equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   [ a b c ]
\&   [a b c]
\&   [, a,b,c ]
\&   [, a, b, c ]
.Ve
.PP
A delimiter is a single character, and the following may not be used
as a delimiter:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   any opening/closing characters () [] {}
\&   single or double quotes
\&   alphanumeric characters
\&   underscore
.Ve
.PP
Whitespace (including newlines) around the delimiter is ignored, so
the following is valid:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   [, a,
\&      b,
\&      c ]
.Ve
.PP
Two delimiters next to each other or a trailing delimiter produce an
empty string.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   "(,a,b,)" => (a, b, \*(Aq\*(Aq)
\&   "(,a,,b)" => (a, \*(Aq\*(Aq, b)
.Ve
.PP
Hashrefs may be specified by braces and the following are equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   { a 1 b 2 }
\&   {, a,1,b,2 }
\&   {, a,1,b,2, }
.Ve
.PP
Note that a trailing delimiter is ignored if there are already an even
number of elements, or an empty string otherwise.
.PP
Nested structures are allowed:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   "[ [1 2] [3 4] ]"
.Ve
.PP
For example,
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => "a [ b c ] { d 1 e 2 } => x y"
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   $o\->tests(
\&      func     => &func,
\&      tests    => [ [a, [b,c], {d=>1,e=>2}] ],
\&      results  => [ [x,y] ],
\&   );
.Ve
.PP
Any single value can be surrounded by single or double quotes in order
to include the delimiter. So:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   "(, a,\*(Aqb,c\*(Aq,e )"
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   "( a b,c e )"
.Ve
.PP
Any single value can be the string '_\|_undef_\|_' which will be turned
into an actual undef. If the value is '_\|_blank_\|_' it is turned into an
empty string (''), though it can also be specified as '' directly. Any
value can have an embedded newline by including a _\|_nl_\|_ in the value,
but the value must be written on a single line.
.PP
Expected results are separated from arguments by ' => '.
.SH "TEST::INTER VARIABLES"
.IX Header "TEST::INTER VARIABLES"
To summarize the information above, the following variables are used
by Test::Inter.  Each variable can be set in two different ways: as
an environment variable and as a perl variable in the main namespace.
.PP
For example, the \s-1TI_END\s0 variable can be set as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   $::TI_END
\&   $ENV{TI_END}
.Ve
.PP
The following variables can be used to define which tests are run:
.IP "\s-1TI_START\s0" 4
.IX Item "TI_START"
Set this to define the test you want to start with.
.Sp
Example: If you have a perl test script and you want to start running
it at test 12, run the following shell commands:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   TI_START=12
\&   ./my_test_script.t
.Ve
.IP "\s-1TI_END\s0" 4
.IX Item "TI_END"
Set this to define the test you want to end with.
.IP "\s-1TI_TESTNUM\s0" 4
.IX Item "TI_TESTNUM"
Set this to run only a single test
.PP
There is also a variable \s-1TI_NUM\s0 (available only as \f(CW$::TI_NUM\fR) which is
set automatically by Test::Inter to be the test currently being run.
.PP
The following variables control what is output from the tests, and how
it is formatted:
.IP "\s-1TI_QUIET\s0" 4
.IX Item "TI_QUIET"
How verbose the test script is.  Values are 0 (most verbose) to 2
(least verbose).
.IP "\s-1TI_MODE\s0" 4
.IX Item "TI_MODE"
How the output is formatted.  Values are 'inter' (interactive mode) or

is for running as part of a test suite.

.SH "HISTORY"
.IX Header "HISTORY"
The history of this module dates back to 1996 when I needed to write a
test suite for my Date::Manip module. At that time, none of the
Test::* modules currently available in \s-1CPAN\s0 existed (the earliest ones
didn't come along until 1998), so I was left completely on my own
writing my test scripts.
.PP
I wrote a very basic version of my test framework which allowed me to
write all of the tests as a string, it would parse the string, count
the tests, and then run them.
.PP
Over the years, the functionality I wanted grew, and periodically, I'd
go back and reexamine other Test frameworks (primarily Test::More) to
see if I could replace my framework with an existing module... and I've
always found them wanting, and chosen to extend my existing framework
instead.
.PP
As I've written other modules, I've wanted to use the framework in
them too, so I've always just copied it in, but this is obviously
tedious and error prone. I'm not sure why it took me so long... but in
2010, I finally decided it was time to rework the framework in a
module form.
.PP
I loosely based my module on Test::More. I like the functionality of
that module, and wanted most of it (and I plan on adding more in
future versions).  So this module uses some similar syntax to
Test::More (though it allows a great deal more flexibility in how the
tests are specified).
.PP
One thing to note is that I may have been able to write this module
as an extension to Test::More, but after looking into that possibility,
I decided that it would be faster to not do that. I did \*(L"borrow\*(R" a couple
of routines from it (though they've been modified quite heavily) as a
starting point for a few of the functions in this module, and I thank
the authors of Test::More for their work.

If you find a bug in Test::Inter, there are three ways to send it to me.
Any of them are fine, so use the method that is easiest for you.
.IP "Direct email" 4
.IX Item "Direct email"
You are welcome to send it directly to me by email.  The email address
to use is:  sbeck@cpan.org.
.IP "\s-1CPAN\s0 Bug Tracking" 4
.IX Item "CPAN Bug Tracking"
You can submit it using the \s-1CPAN\s0 tracking too.  This can be done at the
following \s-1URL:\s0

Please do not use other means to report bugs (such as forums for a specific
\&\s-1OS\s0 or Linux distribution) as it is impossible for me to keep up with all of
them.
.PP
When filing a bug report, please include the following information:
.IP "\fBTest::Inter version\fR" 4
.IX Item "Test::Inter version"
Please include the version of Test::Inter you are using.  You can get
this by using the script:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   use Test::Inter;
\&   print $Test::Inter::VERSION,"\en";
.Ve
.PP
If you want to report missing or incorrect codes, you must be running the
most recent version of Test::Inter.
