.SH "NAME"
Date::Manip::Changes5 \- changes in Date::Manip 5.xx
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This describes the changes made to the Date::Manip module up to the
time that 6.00 was released.  Because 6.00 required a newer version
of perl (5.10 or higher), the old version was maintained.
.PP
When Date::Manip 6.10 was released, both versions were bundled
together (though how it was bundled changed when 6.14 was released).
.PP
This document describes all changes made to the old version of
Date::Manip.
.PP
For the most part, Date::Manip has remained backward compatible at
every release, but occasionally, a change is made which is backward
incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).
.SH "VERSION 5.66 (Released with 6.51)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.66 (Released with 6.51)"
.IP "Fixed a bug in Date_ConvTZ" 4
.IX Item "Fixed a bug in Date_ConvTZ"
Applied a patch supplied by Zhenyi Zhou which fixes a bug in Date_ConvTZ
where passing in an empty string did not work.
.SH "VERSION 5.65 (Released with 6.37)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.65 (Released with 6.37)"
As of December 2012, Version 5 of Date::Manip will no longer be modified.
The 5.xx version was updated to 5.65 (but no changes were made), and this
version is expected to be the final release in the 5.xx series.
.PP
The one exception is that if someone submits a patch that applies cleanly
and causes zero failures in the test suite, I will consider adding it on
a case-by-cast bases.
.PP
Please use Date::Manip 6.xx instead.
.SH "VERSION 5.64 (Released with 6.32)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.64 (Released with 6.32)"
.IP "Better handling of '0000' timezone" 4
.IX Item "Better handling of '0000' timezone"

.SH "VERSION 5.63 (Released with 6.26)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.63 (Released with 6.26)"
.IP "Fixed business mode calculation" 4
.IX Item "Fixed business mode calculation"
Applied a patch that I received some time ago to fix a business
mode calculation.  Steve Tempest
.SH "VERSION 5.62 (Released with 6.21)"

.IP "\fBFully integrated with 6.xx\fR" 4
.IX Item "Fully integrated with 6.xx"
As of Date::Manip 6.14, the 5.xx release is fully integrated into the
distribution. Both will be installed automatically and you can switch
between them (if you have a recent version of perl). This simplifies
the package management process considerably. The downside is that
Date::Manip 6.xx will be installed, even if you do not have a recent
version of perl and cannot use it.
.SH "VERSION 5.59 (Released with 6.12)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.59 (Released with 6.12)"
.IP "Test fixes" 4
.IX Item "Test fixes"
Fix tests to work better on windows.
.SH "VERSION 5.58 (Released with 6.11)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.58 (Released with 6.11)"
.IP "Test fixes" 4
.IX Item "Test fixes"
Fixed a bug in some of the tests that were causing two tests to
fail.  \s-1JD\s0
.Sp
Explicitly set \s-1TZ\s0 in all tests to avoid some failures (it got left out
of a few when it was bundled with 6.10).
.SH "VERSION 5.57 (Released with 6.10)"
.IX Header "VERSION 5.57 (Released with 6.10)"
.IP "\fB(*) Combined 5.xx and 6.xx\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) Combined 5.xx and 6.xx"
As of 6.10, Date\-Manip\-6.xx will contain both the Date::Manip 5.xx and
6.xx modules. If perl 5.10 or higher is available, the 6.xx version
will be installed. For older versions of perl, the 5.xx version will
be installed.
.Sp
This will allow all of the automatic module tools to work correctly.

.IX Item "(!) (*) Recurrences revisited"
.PD
The behavior of some elements of recurrences changed. These included

3rd Friday of every month for example.

Y\-0\-WOY\-DOW now refers to the \s-1WOY\s0'th occurrence of \s-1DOW\s0 instead of the
\&\s-1ISO 8601\s0 date Y\-W(\s-1WOY\s0)\-DOY. Also, changed Y\-0\-WOY\-0 to refer to the

be parsed as dates (i.e. &ParseDate(\*(L"1 hour 20 minutes ago\*(R") is
equivalent to &DateCalc(\*(L"now\*(R",\*(L"1 hour 20 minutes ago\*(R")).  Only text
deltas can be used in this way (i.e. &ParseDate(\*(L"\-0:0:0:0:1:20:0\*(R")

changes specified below.
.IP "\fB(!) (*) ParseDate formats removed\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) (*) ParseDate formats removed"
As a result of \s-1ISO 8601\s0 support, some formats which previously worked
may no longer be parsed since they conflict with an \s-1ISO 8601\s0 format.
These include MM-DD-YY (conflicts with YY-MM-DD) and \s-1YYMMDD\s0 (conflicts
with \s-1YYYYMM\s0).  \s-1MM/DD/YY\s0 still works, so the first form can be kept
easily by changing \*(L"\-\*(R" to \*(L"/\*(R".  \s-1YYMMDD\s0 can be changed to YY-MM-DD
before being parsed.  Whenever parsing dates using dashes as
separators, they will be treated as \s-1ISO 8601\s0 dates.  You can get
around this by converting all dashes to slashes.

.el .IP "\fB(!) UnixDate ``%s'' format\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) UnixDate %s format"
Used to return the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 in the current
time zone.  It now returns the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 \s-1GMT.\s0
The \*(L"%o\*(R" format was added which returns what \*(L"%s\*(R" previously did.
.IP "\fB(!) (*) Internal format of delta\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) (*) Internal format of delta"
The format for the deltas returned by ParseDateDelta changed.  Previously,
each element of a delta had a sign attached to it (+1:+2:+3:+4:+5:+6).  The
new format removes all unnecessary signs by default (+1:2:3:4:5:6).  Also,
because of the way deltas are normalized (see documentation on
ParseDateDelta), at most two signs are included.  For backwards
compatibility, the config variable DeltaSigns was added.  If set to 1, all
deltas include all 6 signs.
.IP "\fB(!) (*) Date_Init arguments\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) (*) Date_Init arguments"
The format of the Date_Init calling arguments changed.  The
old method
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Date_Init($language,$format,$tz,$convtz);
.Ve
.Sp
is still supported , but this support will likely disappear in the future.
Use the new calling format instead:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Date_Init("var=val","var=val",...);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0  The old format is no longer supported as of version 5.32 .
.IP "\fB(*) Added weeks to ParseDateDelta.\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) Added weeks to ParseDateDelta."
Suggested by Mike Bassman.  Note that since this is a late addition, I
did not change the internal format of a delta.  Instead, it is added
to the days field.

\&\fB(*) Modified how deltas are normalized and added the DeltaSigns config
variable.\fR
.Sp
Added \f(CW%q\fR format \*(L"\s-1YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\*(R"\s0 to UnixDate.  Requested by Rob Perelman.
Also added \f(CW%P\fR format \*(L"\s-1YYYYMMDDHH:MM:SS\*(R".\s0
.Sp
Added a new config variable to allow you to work with multiple internal
formats (with and without colons).  Requested by Rob Perelman.
See Date_Init documentation.
.Sp
Added the following formats suggested by Andreas Johansson:
   Sunday week 22 [in 1996] [at 12:00]
   22nd Sunday [in 1996] [at 12:00]
   Sunday 22nd week [in 1996] [at 12:00]
.Sp
Added a new config variable to allow you to define the first day of
the week.  See Date_Init documentation.
.Sp
Added the following formats to ParseDate for convenience (some were
suggested by Mike Bassman):
   next/last Friday [at time]
   next/last week [at time]
   in 2 weeks [at time]
   2 weeks ago [at time]
   Friday in 2 weeks
   in 2 weeks on Friday
   Friday 2 weeks ago
   2 weeks ago Friday
.Sp
Added Date_SecsSince1970GMT, moved the \f(CW%s\fR format to \f(CW%o\fR (secs since 1/1/70)
and added \f(CW%s\fR format (secs since 1/1/70 \s-1GMT\s0).  Based on suggestions by
Mark Osbourne.  Note this introduces a minor backward incompatibility
described above.
.Sp
Date_SetTime now works with international time separators.
.Sp
Added the \f(CW%g\fR format (%a, \f(CW%d\fR \f(CW%b\fR \f(CW%Y\fR \f(CW%H:\fR%M:%S \f(CW%z\fR) for an \s-1RFC 1123\s0 date.
Suggested by Are Bryne.
.Sp
Added options to delete existing holidays and ignore global config file.
.Sp
Date_GetNext and Date_GetPrev now return the next/prev occurrence of a
time as well as a day.  Suggested by Are Bryne.
.Sp
In approximate mode, deltas now come out completely normalized (only 1
sign).  Suggested by Rob Perelman.
.Sp
Added Date::Manip::InitDone so initialization isn't duplicated.
.Sp
Added a 3rd internal format to store YYYY-MM-DD \s-1HH:MN:SS\s0 (iso 8601).
.Sp
Added a config variable to allow you to work with 24 hour business
days.  Suggested by Mike Bassman.
.Sp
ParseDateDelta now returns "\*(L" rather than \*(R"+0:0:0:0:0:0" when there is
an error.

\&\fB(*) The d:h:mn:s of \s-1ALL\s0 deltas are normalized.\fR
.Sp
Huge number of code changes to clean things up.

zones.  Thanks to Are Bryne.

command.  Thanks to Are Bryne.
.Sp
Fixed typo (\s-1CSD\s0 instead of \s-1CST\s0).

The command \*(L"date +%Z\*(R" doesn't work on SunOS machines (and perhaps
others) so 5.05 is effectively broken.  5.06 released to fix this.

date given, have day default to today rather than 1.  It only
defaults to one if a partial date is given.

by Jason Baker

Added Swedish translation (thanks to Andreas Johansson
