For the most part, Date::Manip has remained backward compatible at
every release, but occasionally, a change is made which is backward
incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).

It is possible to specify a recurrence that never produces a valid

The MaxRecurAttempts config variable was added which will stop that

.IP "\fB(*) (!) Changes to deltas\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) Changes to deltas"
Improved handling of deltas to better support the different types of
deltas.  Formalized how the semi-exact portions of the delta are used
to produce the results that most people would expect.
.Sp
The type can now be specified to guarantee several behaviors.
Changed the arguments (in a backward compatible way) to several
methods.  Explicitly added a new type (estimated) which was there
previously, but could not be manually specified.
.Sp
The convert function continues to support converting from a less exact
type to a more exact type, but this is deprecated and will be removed in
version 7.00.
.Sp
This was prompted by a bug reported by Ian Gibbs.
.IP "\fB(*) (!) Deprecated some parts of Date::Manip::Delta\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) Deprecated some parts of Date::Manip::Delta"
The options passed to the \fBset\fR and \fBparse\fR methods have changed.  The
old style will be removed in version 7.00.
.Sp
Deltas will also no longer support the 'exact' and 'approximate' strings
(which have not been supported for some time).  These will be removed
in 7.00 as well.
.IP "Deprecation of \s-1TZ\s0 postponed" 4
.IX Item "Deprecation of TZ postponed"
The deprecation of the \s-1TZ\s0 variable has been postponed to version 7.00.
.IP "Some speed improvements" 4
.IX Item "Some speed improvements"
I converted some of the functions to use faster algorithms.  Previously, the
steps were worked out using logical time/calendar based calculations.  These
were replaced with non-intuitive numerical calculations that gave the same
result faster.
.IP "Changed behavior if timezone not determined" 4
.IX Item "Changed behavior if timezone not determined"
If the system timezone cannot be determined using any of the methods
supplied by Date::Manip, operations will be done in the \s-1GMT\s0 timezone.
Previously, Date::Manip would simply fail to load.  Based on a report by
Kent Fredric (\s-1RT 123229\s0).
.IP "Fixed Makefile.PL" 4
.IX Item "Fixed Makefile.PL"

The deprecation of the \s-1TZ\s0 variable has been postponed to March 2017.  I

.IP "\fB(*) (!) Reworked recurrences\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) Reworked recurrences"
Recurrences were reworked in a (slightly) backward incompatible way to
improve their usefulness (and to make them conform to the expected
results). Most recurrences will work the same as previously, but a few will
differ. Most of this was suggested by Jay Jacobs.
.Sp
A recurring event is now calculated relative to the base date, \s-1NOT\s0 relative
to a previous event. For example, if a recurrence occurs every month, and
the base date was Jan 31, then previously, recurring events would have
been (in a non-leap year):
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   D(0)                   = Jan 31
\&   D(1)  = D(0) + 1 month = Feb 28
\&   D(2)  = D(1) + 1 month = Mar 28
\&   ...
.Ve
.Sp
The new behavior is:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   D(0)                       = Jan 31
\&   D(1)  = D(0) + 1*(1 month) = Feb 28
\&   D(2)  = D(0) + 2*(1 month) = Mar 31
\&   ...
.Ve
.Sp
Previously, if a base date were not specified, it was not determined
from the date range. Now, the start date of the date range acts as the
base date.
.Sp
The meaning of the base date has changed slightly. It is much more
meaningful and useful now.
.Sp
Added iterator functions.  Daniel LaLiberte

Because the automatic module management tools cpan/cpanp would try
to upgrade Date::Manip to the most recent version, and the most
recent version will only work if perl 5.10.0 or higher is installed,
both the 5.xx and 6.xx releases are now combined into a single
distribution.
.Sp
This is described more fully in the Date::Manip::Problems document.
.IP "\fB(!) Zones specified by offset\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) Zones specified by offset"
In all operations involving time zones, the time zone must be determined.
By default, it would take all of the information available (date, \s-1ISDST,\s0
etc.) and determine the most likely time zone. It would take every time zone
that matched each piece of information, starting with those that matched
in a standard time followed by those that matched in a daylight saving
time.
.Sp
When zones are specified by an offset, a standard time would always match
since there are standard time zones that match all year long (the military
time zones A\-Z and the standard time zones of the form Etc/GMT+01). As a
result, a daylight saving time match would never occur.
.Sp
Since (if the date falls during a daylight saving time period) you usually
want to use a time zone that has that offset in daylight saving time,
the default is now to check daylight saving time zones first, followed
by standard times.
.Sp
See the Date::Manip::TZ manual (under the zone method) for more
information.

In Date::Manip 5.xx, the \f(CW%z\fR format in UnixDate printed the offset in
the form \-0500. In 6.00, I changed that to \-05:00:00, but this broke
\&\s-1RFC 822\s0 compliance.
.Sp
I've changed \f(CW%z\fR back to \-0500, and introduced a new format (%N) which
returns \-05:00:00.
.Sp
Incidentally, this is the \s-1LAST\s0 unused letter, so I am now going to
have to either stop adding formats, or add some extended format
syntax. Not sure yet which, but this may involve a backwards
incompatible change in the future.

Parsing will skip some date/time formats if requested. This was first
suggested by Eduard Derksen.

It has been suggested several times to support multiple languages,
multiple config files, or multiple sets of Date_Init
options. These suggestions (by Meng Fang, Ed Avis, Christian
Campbell, and perhaps others) were at the back of my mind as I
